# p5.js

The session's focus was to play with the p5js library. p5js is a library that utilizes [Processing](https://processing.org/) to create generated art. btw, that not the only thing you can do with p5js.

We utilized my repository [cowglow/p5js](https://github.com/cowglow/p5js) to generate these pieces of beautiful art:

![prototype-002](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FViVYwrWQAAbyMz?format=jpg&name=large)

## What we accomplish

- We gained an understanding of the `game loop` that processing has with the `draw()` function
- We manipulated the color using the HSB mode in p5js
- We mock the state to start and stop the `prototype-002` sketch
