# Media (Blog, Video, Audio)

The session's focus was to share my personal experience and insight in various media creation processes. We sat in the patio and discusses the participant's prior experience and attempts. Also ideas of what they would like to possible create.

### The challenges that were identified where:

- Feeling like there is no clearly defined niche
- Feeling like one's personal life or insight is not interesting enough
- Feeling uncomfortable in front of the camera.
- Feeling insecure about one's personal knowledge.

### Some reasons why one would start a blog, podcast or streaming channel.

- Personal Brand building
- Improve presentation and sharing skills
- Notoriety / becoming famous or taking in
